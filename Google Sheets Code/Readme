Code written to be used in Google sheets. It converts preferences sent via Google form to CSS code.
This code is used to modify the design of the scheduling tool interface.

-----
The code is divided in two main parts:
1- A big function that converts all the different inputs of preferences into a CSS code.
2- A loop that checks how many replies are in the spreadsheet, and runs the big function once per HE.

-----
After receiving the output code for all the HEs, this is added to TamperMonkey's script:
https://github.com/nunyvega/Scheduling-tools/blob/master/Tampermonkey%20Scripts/Append%20preferences%20CSS
to add the CSS code to the scheduling page.
