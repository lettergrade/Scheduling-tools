This code adds color to the first hours of the day (00 in local time) in Humanity's interface, specifically in the visual view.
This is used so schedulers don't overschedule HEs that have availabilities that are hard to read.

The script works in 2 steps:

1- HEs details are added to the Google sheets file used for the purpose. THe sheets file already has the script added in this repository.
This will automatically calculate and return the CSS code.

2- The CSS code returned by the sheet then is pasted in the Tampermonkey script, that will push the CSS code to Humanity's interface.
